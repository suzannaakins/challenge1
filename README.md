# Project Title
Bootcamp Challenge 1: Horiseon Website
​
## Description 
​This challenge involved corrected pre-existing code to improve accessibility. My motivation was to get better at organizing code, adding semantic elements, consolidating code so it's not repetitive, and adding aria labels. 

I cloned the pre-existing code from a Github repository, brought it into VS Code, and got to work on the HTML and CSS files, which was fun. I realized that I think I really like de-bugging work.  It was quick and easy for me to find why the first nav link didn't work - a simple mistake in the HTML id.  I also realized that Github makes me want to throw heavy objects into bigger, heavier objects, until everything breaks. Like how my soul is breaking when I use Github. 

So, needless to say, my biggest challenge was using Github. After I cloned the files, I finished the entire project (corrected all the code, cleaned it up, etc.). Then I went back to my challenge instructions, and realized I was supposed to commit all my changes and have a repository for it.  So I made a new repository on my Github for these files. I cloned THAT repository to my computer and tried to commit my work, but alas, error messages galore.  I called my brother who is a physics PhD and coding nerd, and he saved me by walking me through it.  First I made a copy of my work in case I lost it while trying to make the new repository. Then he had me delete the git that the project was currently linked to, create a new repository on my github, then do a new git init, cloned my new repository, and somehow committed the files to it instead. It was a headache, and Git still confuses me like crazy, but I think I got one step further by hopefully not making the same mistake next time. I ended up having to undo everything I had done, and then slowly redo-ing the changes and committing them incrementally to show my work and progress. 

The actual changing of the code part I loved!  Another challenge (related to the actual coding this time) was adding a screenreader to the HERO image.  I went to the Run Buddy project to see how we did it in that project since the img file was also in the CSS file and should be similar method, only to find out we DIDN'T!  How rude!  Blind and visually impaired people deserve to see the biggest photo on a webpage.  So I did some poking around and (hopefully) found a way to do it. I added text describing the image to the HTML "hero" section, and moved it wayyyyyy to the left margin so it's not VISIBLE, but hopefully a screen reader would read it aloud.
